# Amazon Automation Project (Selenium + Python + Pytest)

This project automates a basic Amazon workflow using **Selenium WebDriver**, **Python**, and **Pytest**.  
It is part of my **45-Day Selenium Learning Plan** and currently includes:

- Searching for a product on Amazon
- Applying brand filters (e.g., HP laptops)
- Skipping sponsored results
- Selecting the first valid product
- Extracting multiple product details (title, price, link) and saving them to CSV
- GitHub version control integration
